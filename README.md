Advent of Code solutions in Rust

## Goals

- Solve a variety of problems using Rust
- Minimal usage of dependencies (ideally only nom for parsing input)
- Both parts should run under 1 second (where possible)
    - Ideally, both parts should run in under 100 ms
- Write idiomatic code that is read, understand, and
    - It is a non-goal to write a solution that is as small as possible
- Code should generally be testable, especially in later days
